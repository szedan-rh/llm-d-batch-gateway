## Docker images

Images are published to GitHub Container Registry. For this release, use the tag `$TAG` (e.g. `v1.0.0`).

## Helm chart (OCI)

The Helm chart is published to GitHub Container Registry for each release. Install using the chart semver from `Chart.yaml` (no `v` prefix — for tag `$TAG` such as `v1.0.0`, use `--version 1.0.0`):

```bash
helm install batch-gateway oci://ghcr.io/llm-d/charts/batch-gateway --version "${TAG#v}"
```

## Upgrade notes

_Add any migration or upgrade instructions here._

## Binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux (amd64, arm64) are attached as **`.tar.gz`** archives (preserves execute bit on extract). The Helm chart is attached as **`batch-gateway-<semver>.tgz`**. **`SHA256SUMS`** lists digests for those archives and the chart — verify with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`, then e.g. `tar xzf batch-gateway-apiserver-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
