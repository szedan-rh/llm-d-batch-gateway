// jobExecutionParams holds the job-scoped state shared across processing stages.

// here so that the watchCancel goroutine can call them when a cancel event arrives.
// userCancelFn cancels userCancelCtx (user-cancel signal, derived from context.Background).
// requestAbortFn cancels requestAbortCtx (dispatch loop control, derived from sloCtx) to stop
// dispatch immediately when the user cancels.
